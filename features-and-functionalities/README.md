## 🔐 API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to protect sensitive data, ensure system integrity, and maintain user trust. This project implements several key security measures across all endpoints and services.

🔑 1. Authentication
Purpose: Ensure that only registered users can access protected resources.

Implementation:

Uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.

Token is issued during login and must be sent in the Authorization header for protected endpoints.

Supports token expiration and refresh token mechanism for long-term access.

Why it matters:
Protects user accounts and personal data from unauthorized access.

🛡️ 2. Authorization
Purpose: Restrict actions based on user roles and permissions.

Implementation:

Role-based access control (RBAC) for distinguishing between hosts and guests.

Certain endpoints (e.g., creating properties, accessing bookings) are restricted based on the user's role.

Django permissions and custom decorators enforce access rules.

Why it matters:
Prevents unauthorized users from performing actions like modifying someone else’s property or accessing other users’ bookings.

📊 3. Rate Limiting
Purpose: Prevent abuse of the API (e.g., brute-force attacks, denial of service).

Implementation:

Middleware (e.g., Django Ratelimit or throttling from Django REST Framework) to cap the number of requests per IP or user.

Adjustable thresholds for different endpoints.

Why it matters:
Protects the API from malicious users who might overload the server or attempt to break authentication through brute force.

🧊 4. Data Validation and Sanitization
Purpose: Protect against injection attacks and malformed input.

Implementation:

Use of Django and DRF serializers to validate and sanitize all incoming data.

Custom validators to enforce domain-specific rules.

Why it matters:
Prevents SQL injection, XSS, and other forms of input-based attacks that could compromise the application.

🔒 5. HTTPS Enforcement
Purpose: Encrypt data in transit between client and server.

Implementation:

All production deployments will enforce HTTPS using secure SSL/TLS certificates (e.g., via Nginx + Let's Encrypt).

Why it matters:
Protects sensitive data like passwords, tokens, and payment info from being intercepted during transmission.

💳 6. Payment Security
Purpose: Safeguard financial transactions and user billing data.

Implementation:

Payments processed via third-party providers (e.g., Stripe) with secure APIs.

Backend never stores raw payment details—only transaction references and statuses.

Why it matters:
Avoids exposure of critical financial information and ensures compliance with industry standards like PCI-DSS.

✅ Additional Security Practices
CORS Management: Configured to allow requests only from trusted frontend domains.

Environment Variables: Secrets and API keys are never hardcoded; managed via .env files.

Logging & Monitoring: All authentication failures and suspicious activities are logged and reviewed.

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

🛠 What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery. It is a set of practices that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code to production environments.

Continuous Integration (CI): Every change pushed to the codebase is automatically built and tested. This helps detect issues early and ensures code quality.

Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD): After CI passes, the application is automatically deployed to a staging or production environment. This ensures rapid and reliable delivery of new features and bug fixes.

💡 Why CI/CD is Important for This Project
Implementing a CI/CD pipeline ensures that:

✅ Code changes are tested automatically before merging to main branches.

🚫 Broken code never gets deployed.

⚙️ Deployments are consistent and reproducible across environments.

🧪 All features pass automated tests, reducing manual QA effort.

📦 New releases can be shipped quickly and safely.

This is particularly crucial in a project like Airbnb Clone, which handles user authentication, property data, and payments — all of which require high reliability and security.

🧰 Tools for CI/CD
Here are the tools used or recommended in this project to implement a full CI/CD pipeline:

Tool	Purpose
GitHub Actions	Automate tests, builds, and deployment workflows
Docker	Containerize the application for consistent environments
Docker Compose	Manage multi-container services (e.g., backend + PostgreSQL)
Heroku / Render / AWS / Railway	Deployment platforms to host the backend
pytest / Django Test Suite	Run automated tests before deployment

Example workflow includes:

Run tests on every push or pull request

Build Docker image and push to a container registry (e.g., GitHub Container Registry)

Deploy to a hosting service once the tests pass

📌 CI/CD Summary
CI/CD integration improves the reliability, quality, and speed of development. With automated testing and deployment, developers can focus more on writing features rather than worrying about infrastructure or regressions.
